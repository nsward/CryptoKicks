# Crypto Kicks  
  
ERC-721 contract for Apprent.io's Crypto Kicks. Still very much a work in progress. Some of the changes / additions to the standard ERC-721:  
  
- Instead of standard tokenURIs to store the metadata, we had talked about using IPFS, so the contract stores IPFS hashes in <a href="https://github.com/multiformats/multihash">multihash</a> format and implements a bit of a hack (which I don't think works yet) to return them from the tokenURI() function as a string per the ERC721 standard. I think we could also get away with just storing these as normal strings and dealing with any hash format variations outside the contract. I've never actually built an ERC721 that uses IPFS, but my understanding is that we want these IPFS hashes to return a JSON blob that fits the "<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md">ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema</a>".  
  
- The owner of the contract (original deployer) can add the kids' addresses to the contract to approve them to mint tokens up to the tokensPerStudent limit (i.e. 4 crpyto kicks per student). If the kids don't actually want to mint their own tokens on the blockchain, we can also just have the contract owner deploy all the metadata to IPFS and mint all the tokens, then send them to the kids' addresses.
